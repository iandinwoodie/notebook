## iOS/iPadOS

### Device Setup

#### Backup

- Connect iOS/iPadOS device to macOS device to import photos.
  - Open the Photos app and select your connected device.
  - Check the "Delete after Import" option.
  - Import all photos.
- Create a local backup as a recovery measure.

#### Device Reset

- Choose "Erase all content and settings" from the device settings.
- Once the erase is finished, progress through the device setup screens.
  - Make sure to sign in using your Apple ID.
  - Choose "Don't Transfer Apps & Data" when asked.
- NOTICE: Do not start downloading your missing apps.
  - Iron out everything in the Apple ecosystem before you introduce further
  variables.

#### iCloud

- Turn off iCloud Photos and My Photo Stream.
  - You can leave Shared Albums checked.
- Create a backup and then find that backup via "Manage Storage -> Backups".
  - Disable any items that you don't want in your backup.
  - Temporarily disable Photos backups.
- Delete your last backup and generate a new backup.
  - Verify that only the items you left enabled are included in this backup.
  - You may find that there is still a Photos backup despite it being disabled.
    - Navigate to "General -> iPhone Storage" and delete the photo and video
    attachments that are lingering around.
    - NOTICE: This step might need to be moved to a different stage of setup. I
    can't remember if this is when I performed it.
  - Repeat the delete & regenerate backup step until you are satisfied with the
  contents of the backup.
- Reenable Photo backups to make sure there is some way to recover them in the
  event that your device is lost or damaged.

# Competitive Programming

## Tips

These tips were largely provided by the Leetcode Patterns repo [1]:

- If input array is sorted, then:
  - Binary search
  - Two pointers
- If asked for all permutations/subsets, then:
  - Backtracking
- If given a linked list, then:
  - Two pointers
- If given a tree/graph, then:
  - DFS
  - BFS
- If recursion is disallowed, then:
  - Stack
- If requested to solve in-place, then:
  - Swap corresponding values
  - Store one or more different values in the same pointer
- If asked for minimum/maximum subarray/subset, then:
  - Dynamic programming
- If asked for top/least K items, then:
  - Heap
- If asked for common strings, then:
  - Map
  - Trie
- Else:
  - Map/set for O(1) time & O(n) space
  - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
